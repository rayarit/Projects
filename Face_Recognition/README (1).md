# Face Recognition Project
This project focuses on recognizing faces in images and video feeds using deep learning.
## Overview

- **Model:** FaceNet / VGGFace
- **Dataset:** Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) / Custom dataset
- **Tools:** Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Goal:** To recognize and identify known faces from a dataset or in real-time.
## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Computer-Vision-Projects.git
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Train or load a pre-trained face recognition model.
Run face recognition on an image or video.

Results
The model can recognize faces with an accuracy of X% on the test set.

Future Work
Implement real-time face recognition using a live video feed.
Improve recognition accuracy by fine-tuning the model with more data.
These README files provide a clear structure, usage instructions, and scope for each project. You can customize the content further based on the actual datasets, models, and performance metrics you achieve.
